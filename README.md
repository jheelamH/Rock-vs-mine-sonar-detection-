Rock vs Mine Sonar Detection Project

Overview

This project aims to detect and classify objects in sonar imagery as either "rock" or "mine" using a deep learning model. Sonar images are commonly used in underwater exploration and navigation. The goal of this project is to develop an efficient deep learning model that can differentiate between rocks and mines based on sonar signal data.

Objective
Detect objects in sonar images.

Classify these objects as either "Rock" or "Mine".

Use a simple deep learning model to classify the sonar signals, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or other appropriate architectures.
Dataset
The dataset consists of sonar images, each representing an object in an underwater environment. These images are labeled with their corresponding category (either "Rock" or "Mine"). The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing subsets.

Dataset format: Images in .png or .jpg format.

Labels: Two categories—Rock, Mine.

If the dataset is not provided, you can use any publicly available sonar datasets.
Technologies Used
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Data Processing: NumPy.

Other Libraries: Pandas (for handling data), Matplotlib(for visualization), Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics).
Installation
To get started with the project, you need to have Python 3.6+ installed. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Requirements
tensorflow or torch (depending on the framework you prefer)

numpy

matplotlib

pandas

scikit-learn

Usage
Preprocess the dataset:
To prepare the images for training, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Train the model:
To start the training process, execute:

bash
Copy code
python src/train.py
Evaluate the model:
Once the model has been trained, you can evaluate its performance on the test set with:

bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate.py
Visualize Results:
After evaluation, you can visualize some of the test predictions using matplotlib to see how well the model has performed.
Model Architecture
The model consists of the following key components:

Input Layer: The input is a sonar image, typically with a shape of (height, width, 1) for grayscale images.

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to capture important features from the sonar images (such as edges and textures).

MaxPooling Layers: To downsample the feature maps and reduce the complexity.

Fully Connected (Dense) Layers: These layers take the flattened feature maps from convolutional layers and learn to classify the objects as either "Rock" or "Mine".

Output Layer: A softmax output layer for binary classification.
Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the model, the following metrics will be used:

Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified images.

Precision: The percentage of correctly predicted "Rock" or "Mine" objects out of all predictions for that class.

Recall: The percentage of correctly predicted "Rock" or "Mine" objects out of all actual instances of that class.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
Results
Once the model is trained, you should observe the following metrics (or similar):

Training Accuracy: 83.4%

Validation Accuracy: 92%

Test Accuracy: 90%
Challenges & Future Improvements
Noise in the sonar images: Sonar data often contains noise due to water conditions. Future improvements could involve using advanced image filtering techniques.

Model Complexity: The model could be further optimized using more complex architectures like ResNet or InceptionV3.

Real-time detection: To enable real-time classification, further optimizations would be required to make the model faster.
